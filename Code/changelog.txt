admin page to select when user is allowed to book
also system to prevent bookings from having conflicting times

might need to change user idenifier

add some where in api that will check if user is admin
it should be done in back/api and store on mongodb
it should only sure admin information if user is admin,

if client logs in, the event should only show their, non bookable and active bookings.
user email is currently being saved to new booking, can use that to check in api or backend

may wnat to create session ids, we can not only use email as that is a security risk

working on limited the number of days after the current day the user is allowed to book
not working in customcomputer/index.js yet

there is problem with hasselectmassagelenght in create eventpopup, if user select a lenght, select a lenght close and selects another

there is some problem with the create booking, with need to select the lenght twice, otherwise the to time is not updating, it will be selected but not update to correct until later

change the handle close function to make sure that data is reset
massage lenght also needs to be fixed, the alert is printing incorrect time, but the actual time is correct

make admin page work again
currently only delete booking works
